# How to Link Header File "stats.h" from Another Folder to "main.c"

To link a header file from another folder to your main C file, you can use the `#include` directive along with the relative path or by specifying the path in your project settings. Here are two approaches:

1. **Using Relative Path in `#include` Directive:**
   You can include the header file in your main.c using a relative path. Assuming "stats.h" is in a folder named "include," and your main.c is in the project root, you can do:

   ```c
   #include "include/stats.h"
   ```

   This informs the compiler to look for "stats.h" in the "include" folder relative to the location of your main.c file.

2. **Configuring Project Settings:**
   Another approach is to set the path in your project settings:

   - Right-click on the project.
   - Select Properties.
   - Navigate to Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General.
   - Set the path under Additional Include Directories.

   This method allows you to specify the folder where the compiler should look for header files.
